# ManualCellCounter
An Excel macro for doing manual WBC and RBC count on body fluids using the Kova hemacytometer.

I hope you find this useful.  Also if you or someone you know works in a Sunquest or HMS lab, please tell them to check out my pending test log solution â€“ OL Monitor (http://www.olmonitor.com) .
The Problem:

Doing a manual cell count with a mechanical counter is fine, but most of us aren't that great at doing the calculation in our heads in the process of counting.  

My Solution:
The macro updates the count in real-time and adjusts for dilution.  You can also simply type the numbers into the boxes to do the calculation after counting using other method.  
This is also great for doing a quick manual check of an automated count. You can count a few fields and know right away if the numbers correlate.
